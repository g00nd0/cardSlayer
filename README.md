### Description

You are the CardSlayer, a world-renowed demon hunter and exorcist. Enter this spooky mansion and eliminate all the demons and evil spirits that haunt these walls, before they kill you!

CardSlayer is a derivation of the card game, Concentration. This is a card game where all cards are laid face down on a surface, and 2 cards are flipped up each turn to see if they're matching pairs.

At the start of each level, a grid of cards will be set on screen, and each card will have a matching card somewhere in the grid. You have to reveal cards and try to match the exact pair. You lose health every time you flip 2 non-matching cards.

As you progress on each level, the grid size (i.e. number of cards) increases.

### Objectives
Eliminate all the ghosts and demons (Meaning reveal all card pairs)

### Gameplay
1. You start with 100% health at the start of the game. You lose health every time you flip 2 non-matching cards. If your health reaches zero, you're dead.
2. A grid of cards will be set on the screen. The size of the grid (i.e. number of cards) determines the difficulty. (or health of the demon)
3. Select two cards to reveal them. If the cards do not match, the cards flip back. If they match, the cards are removed from the grid, and the demon is one step closer to death. Permenantly. The demon dies when all cards have been revealed.
4. Some cards have power-ups that can aid you in your game. These are:

  a. Shotgun: Randomly removes 2 matching card pairs from the card grid.

  b. Clairvoyance: Reveals all cards 3 seconds before being flipped back.

  c. R.P.G. (Ridiculously overPowered Gun): Randomly removes 6 matching card pairs from the card grid.
