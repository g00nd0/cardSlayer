### Description
This is simply a card memory game, but with a countdown. At the start of each level, a grid of cards will be set on screen, and there are 2 of the same cards present. You have to reveal cards and try to match the exact pair. As you progress on each level, the grid size (i.e. number of cards) increases.

### Objectives
Rip & tear until it's done. (Meaning reveal all card pairs)

### Gameplay
1. At the start of the game, there is a countdown timer. As the time goes down, you lose health. If your health reaches zero, you're dead.
2. A grid of cards will be set on the screen. The size of the grid (i.e. number of cards) determines the difficulty (or health of the demon)
3. Select two cards to reveal them. If the cards do not match, the cards flip back. If they match, you earn points/shoot demon, demon dies when all cards have been revealed.
4. Some cards have power-ups that remove cards from screen, i.e. so less cards = end round in shorter time/kill demon faster. ( or penalty cards?, take away health)
